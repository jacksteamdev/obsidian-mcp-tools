# Changelog

All notable changes to **MCP Connector** (formerly `obsidian-mcp-tools`) are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.3.3] — 2026-04-21

### Added
- `OBSIDIAN_API_URL` env var support as a convenience alias that
  parses into host / port / protocol. The more specific
  `OBSIDIAN_HOST`, `OBSIDIAN_PORT` and `OBSIDIAN_USE_HTTP` variables
  still take precedence when set, preserving drop-in compatibility
  with upstream v0.2.x configurations. Fixes upstream issue #66.

### Fixed
- `normalizeInputSchema` now strips `additionalProperties: {}` (the
  empty-object form emitted by some schema generators), which
  strict MCP validators such as Letta Cloud reject with a 500.
  `additionalProperties: true`, `false`, and genuine sub-schemas are
  left untouched. Fixes upstream issue #63.
- `makeRequest` collapses consecutive slashes in request paths, so a
  caller-supplied directory with a trailing slash (`"DevOps/"`) no
  longer produces `/vault/DevOps//` and the subsequent 404 from the
  Local REST API. Fixes upstream issue #37.

### Changed
- Extracted `buildPatchHeaders` and `normalizeAppendBody` from the
  `patch_active_file` / `patch_vault_file` handlers as pure helpers,
  and added regression tests for the URL-encoded `Target` header
  (Cyrillic, CJK, accented + bracketed strings) and the trailing-
  newline safeguard on `append`. No behavior change — this pins
  the 0.3.0 fixes for upstream issues #30, #71, and #78 against
  accidental regression.
- Extended the regression-test pin to cover three additional 0.3.0
  fixes that were landed but never credited or test-covered:
  client-side `limit` truncation on `search_vault_simple` (#62),
  the optional `certificateInfo` / `apiExtensions` shape on the
  Local REST API root response (#68), and the optional
  `frontmatter.tags` on `ApiVaultFileResponse` that unblocks
  `execute_template` for tagless Templater templates (#41).
  Extracted `applySimpleSearchLimit` as a pure helper for symmetry
  with the other patch-handler extracts. No behavior change.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-04-17

### Changed
- Migrated the MCP server from the deprecated `Server` class to `McpServer` (SDK 1.29.0 high-level API). The underlying `Server` is still reachable via `McpServer.server` for the low-level `setRequestHandler` routing used by the custom `ToolRegistry`.
- Sentence-case pass on user-facing `Notice` text.

### Fixed
- Lint pass over the `ObsidianReviewBot` findings across all three packages (plugin, shared, MCP server):
  - typed error stringification (`error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)`) on every template-literal fallback;
  - `void`-prefixed fire-and-forget Svelte `mount`/`unmount` and `bun:test` `mock.module` calls;
  - removed useless `async` on `setup()` helpers and `getLocalRestApiKey`; added `.catch()` handler on the RxJS `lastValueFrom` in `main.ts`;
  - removed `any` from the Smart Connections v2/v3 compatibility wrapper via minimal inline types (both code paths preserved);
  - replaced the workspace self-import in `packages/shared` with a relative path;
  - miscellaneous cleanups: `String.raw` regex literal, `parseInt` radix, unused catch bindings, unused imports, empty-object types tightened.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- Trimmed the `manifest.json` description to satisfy community-store reviewer-bot rules (removed the `Obsidian` token, aligned with the description used in `community-plugins.json`).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- Rebrand to **MCP Connector** (`id: mcp-tools-istefox`, author: Stefano Ferri). The fork is now publicly published as `istefox/obsidian-mcp-connector`.
- Issue #29 command-execution feature set: per-vault allowlist + confirmation modal + audit log + presets, all gated by a master toggle (disabled by default). See `docs/design/issue-29-command-execution.md` for the full threat model.
- End-user README rewrite covering installation, configuration, MCP-client compatibility, security posture, and development workflow.
- Migration guide for users switching from upstream (`docs/migration-from-upstream.md`).

### Fixed
- `bun run version <part>` now reads the semver part from the correct argv index (was always falling back to `patch`).
- Release pipeline paths corrected so the cross-platform build workflow produces the expected artifacts.
- Upstream issue #77 regression: tools with `arguments: {}` now emit `inputSchema` with an explicit `properties` key — fixes strict MCP clients such as `openai-codex`.
- Smart Connections v3 compatibility (the wrapper now handles both `window.SmartSearch` in v2.x and `env.smart_sources` in v3+).
- `patch_active_file` / `patch_vault_file`: resolve partial heading
  names to full hierarchical paths (e.g. `"Section A"` →
  `"Top Level::Section A"`) before issuing the PATCH, preventing
  silent content corruption when the target sits under a parent
  heading. Fixes upstream issues #30 and #71. (Shipped in the
  0.3.0 cut via commit `d75e493`; credited retroactively here.)
- `patch_active_file` / `patch_vault_file`: URL-encode the `Target`
  and `Target-Delimiter` HTTP headers so non-ASCII heading names
  (Cyrillic, CJK, emoji, accented characters) survive the HTTP
  header grammar. Encoding happens after path resolution so the
  indexer lookup still matches unencoded file content. Fixes
  upstream issue #78.
- `patch_active_file` / `patch_vault_file`: append content is now
  normalized to end with `\n\n` so subsequent sections remain
  visually separated instead of colliding (e.g. `**done**## Next`).
- New `createTargetIfMissing` parameter on both patch tools lets
  callers opt into strict mode (return an explicit error instead
  of silently creating a new target at EOF when the lookup fails).
  Defaults to `true` for upstream compatibility.
- `search_vault_simple`: added an optional `limit` parameter that
  truncates the result array client-side (the underlying Local
  REST API `/search/simple/` endpoint has no native `limit` flag,
  so we slice after receiving the response). Prevents context-
  window overflow on common terms that match thousands of files,
  which otherwise forces MCP clients into the "tool result stored
  to a file" fallback and breaks conversational flow. Fixes
  upstream issue #62. (Shipped in the 0.3.0 cut via commit
  `539e115`; credited retroactively here.)
- `ApiStatusResponse`: `certificateInfo` and `apiExtensions` are
  now optional on the Local REST API `GET /` root response. The
  plugin emits them only when the caller is authenticated, so
  the MCP server's startup probe (which runs before auth is in
  place for some flows) must still accept the trimmed body —
  hard-requiring them made every MCP tool call fail with an
  ArkType validation error on Local REST API v3.4.x. Fixes
  upstream issue #68. (Shipped in the 0.3.0 cut via commit
  `92b233c`; credited retroactively here.)
- `ApiVaultFileResponse`: `frontmatter.tags` is now optional.
  Obsidian emits the `tags` key only when the note's YAML
  frontmatter actually declares one — very common for Templater
  templates and freshly-created notes to lack it. The previous
  hard requirement surfaced as `frontmatter.tags must be an
  array (was null)` and broke `execute_template` and prompt
  loading. Fixes upstream issue #41. (Shipped in the 0.3.0 cut
  via commit `0b39524`; credited retroactively here.)
